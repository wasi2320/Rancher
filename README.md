**Rancher Deployment with Terraform**

This repository contains Terraform configurations for setting up Rancher, a Kubernetes management platform, on a cloud provider infrastructure. Rancher simplifies Kubernetes management by providing a unified interface for cluster deployment, monitoring, and scaling.

**Features**

Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.
Deployment of Rancher server for Kubernetes management.
Configuration for secure and scalable architecture.
Easy-to-use variable configuration for customization.

**Prerequisites**

Before using this repository, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

Terraform (v1.0.0 or later)
AWS CLI (for AWS-based deployments, if applicable)
A valid cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP)
Access credentials for your cloud provider

**Files and Directories**

main.tf: Core Terraform configuration for deploying infrastructure.
output.tf: Outputs that display key deployment information.
vars.tf: Definition of variables used in the configuration.
terraform.tfvars: Example file for setting up your specific variable values.
module/: Directory containing reusable Terraform modules to create the entire infrastructure.
Modules
The module/ directory includes the following components to create and manage a secure and scalable infrastructure:

**VPC Module**:
Provisions a secure Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and routing configurations.

**Bastion Host**: Deploys a bastion host for secure SSH access to private resources. 

**Private Machines**: Configures private EC2 instances for secure backend operations.

**EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Deploys an EKS cluster for Kubernetes orchestration and integrates it with Rancher.

**Rancher**: Installs and configures the Rancher server for managing Kubernetes clusters.

**Certificate Manager**: Enables secure HTTPS communication using AWS Certificate Manager.

**Security Groups**: Sets up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring resource isolation and protection.

Setup Instructions

git clone https://github.com/wasi2320/Rancher.git

cd Rancher

Configure Variables

Edit the terraform.tfvars file with your specific configuration details, such as cloud provider credentials, region, and instance types.

terraform plan

terraform apply

Type yes to confirm and start the deployment.


Access Rancher
Once the infrastructure is provisioned, Rancher's endpoint URL and access information will be displayed in the output. Use these details to log in to Rancher and begin managing your Kubernetes clusters.
